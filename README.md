# React Native Movies App

This repository contains a mobile application built with React Native and Expo. The app allows users to browse and search for movies using the TMDB API. It consists of two screens implemented with React Navigation: a movie listings screen and a movie details screen. The application state is managed using React Redux. Unit tests for components and reducers are included using Jest and Testing Library.
